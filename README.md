Looks like we've made our First Contract!

## Profit Splitter Contract
This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently

WE are using Visual Studio Code' Remix plugin and Metamask to connect the contrat with our local blockchain using Ganache for testing porpuses.

*The owner's acoount = *0xec449D5b1ca25b481621b7d20D7621737068De1b*

The three adresses are taken from Ganache account as follows;

* employee_one = *0x20C0fFcf54F8bCc1f550e6Ca5Ab7093ED452e983*
* employee_two = *0x5ea1fcFdE6234Df8755b74AD5ac1443f0e687Daf*
* employee_three = *0xE970e17E520C5643E3FE1ed814Cf7f7F53E6a7af*
